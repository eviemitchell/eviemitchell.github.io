          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>People under 29 especially report growing concern about the climate, and a <a href="https://theconversation.com/pews-new-global-survey-of-climate-change-attitudes-finds-promising-trends-but-deep-divides-167847" style="text-decoration: underline;">high level of willingness</a> to change their lifestyle to reduce their own impact, but also feel increasingly doubtful that their actions have any meaningful impact. However, <a href="https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste/" style="text-decoration: underline;">half of all food waste</a> happens at home - making it one of the few areas where individual actions truly have significant impact.</p>

          <h3>01 Understanding the User</h3>
          <p>Interested in sustainability myself, I interviewed my peers to explore their feelings, and recognized a pervasive trend of a feeling of insignificance. One interviewee said that ‚ÄúI think my small near insignificant choices can‚Äôt fix problems that are caused by large corporations‚Äô ignorant decisions.‚Äù</p>
          <h4>Young adults in 2021 care about the environment, but feel helpless to make change.</h4>
          <p> To confirm the validity of this understanding, I surveyed 100+ college students on their feelings. I found that the majority of my participants did <b>not</b> believe that individuals can impact the environment with their own actions. And yet, 83% of those ‚ÄúNo‚Äùs still reported making changes in their lifestyle in an effort to protect the environment. Even as they say they can‚Äôt make a difference, they try their best anyways. </p>
          <h4> Underlying the skepticism is a strong desire and willingness to make a difference with their personal choices.</h4>

          <h3>02 Secondary Research</h3>
          <h4> How can we empower individuals to make a meaningful environmental impact?</h4>
          <p>My users grew up painstakingly turning off the faucet while brushing their teeth, double-checking their lights were off each day, and speed-showering every night, with assurance from the world around them it would stop global warming. But now, they face a very different reality. When you save maybe a few gallons of water a year by minding the faucet, but the factory production of a single t-shirt uses 659 gallons of water, of course it feels like you aren‚Äôt making a difference. But in my research, I found something surprising:</p>

          <h3>04 Learnings ‚ú®</h3>
          <h4> 1. Test again (and again and again) </h4>
          <p> In later user testing, I realized that this product would struggle to help users with roommates and family members that aren‚Äôt using the app. I never solved the edge case issues of how to track these other food purchases and consumption, or how to prevent a simple slip of forgetting to mark off items in the app. In the future, I need to more thoroughly test systems in their actual context (here, a full week of eating and shopping), to better understand how I can prevent these issues. </p>
          <h4>2. "Delightful" design </h4> <p> I‚Äôve heard this word used to describe UX so often - but I think my end-of-semester critique on this project is when I finally understood it. A peer gave me the feedback that each helpful expiration reminder would become another chore in the user‚Äôs mind - ‚ÄúUgh, now I have to eat that peach!‚Äù. By incorporating alternatives at this stage (‚ÄúFreeze them!‚Äù, ‚ÄúMake this easy peach jam!‚Äù, etc.), we could turn this moment of frustration into a new opportunity for joy. This realization really struck me, and I can‚Äôt wait to carry this lesson of delight over mundanity into my future design work. </p>

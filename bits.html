          <h3>Contribution Note</h3>
          <p> User research was conducted collaboratively with another designer, while I was responsible for the design system, branding, and creating all components. We then split design tasks per user flow - all of the prototype screens and research artifacts shown here are my individual work, unless noted. Features and components I did not create are excluded or clearly marked to show my contribution. </p>

          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p> Georgia-based non-profit Canine Assistants breeds, raises, and educates service dogs, providing life-saving companions to people with disabilities across the United States free of charge. A family-run operation since 1991, they graduate ~100 service dogs annually, with hundreds living at their farm at any time.</p>
          <h4>Our research found that Canine Assistants has very little record-keeping of the 150+ dogs in their care, and no system at all for the 2500+ dogs they've graduated and placed across the country.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section">
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>Canine Assistants has only a few scattered paper records of the dogs currently in their care, and those they've raised and placed in homes and hospitals across the country. They want to keep track of them, keep in contact with the dogs' new owners, monitor their health, and track long-term trends across their population of graduated dogs.</p>
          <h4>How might we track a service dog's medical, behavioral, and educational history over years of location and caretaker changes? </h4>

        <!--
        <div class="project-section">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <h4>By building a database of comprehensive chronological records, contributed by all the dog's caretakers in standardized, filterable updates.</h4>

          <h3>01 Understanding Product & User Needs</h3>
          <p> To assess the non-profits‚Äô needs and understand how our team can help, we held weekly discussions with the non-profit director, while I conducted user interviews across the Canine Assistants ecosystem. With my partner designer, we spoke with their aftercare point-of-contact, hospital service dog handlers, and volunteers, analyzing themes across the interview results.</p>
          <h4>By mapping out the goals of each user group, we recognized the need for a consolidated record-keeping system, and defined the basic use cases for interacting with the database.</h4>

          <h3>02 Concept Iteration & Wireframing</h3>
          <p>With our tight workflow of keeping design 2 weeks ahead of the development team, I continued user research while building out the basic dashboard. Through continued interviews, I learned more about the needs of our individual user groups.</p>
          <h4>Aftercare coordinators are bombarded with concerns by anxious new recipients, and have to contact 5+ past caretakers for their records to get a better understanding of the dog‚Äôs past.</h4>
          <img src="bits/records.png">
          <h4>So, we created the chronological log system, to be used across the dog's lifetime by every carer that interacts with it. </h4>
